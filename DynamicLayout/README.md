DynamicLayout
===========================================================
This module provides a dynamic layouting mechanism depending on the type of devices. For big screens, a tab-oriented arrangement of components allows to rearrange the components by drag and drop while the mobile layouting mechanism offers access to the different components by a menu triggered by a button on the top left of the screen.
